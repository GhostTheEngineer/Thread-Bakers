            /* Inner Scope Explained
                
                Why have inner scope?

                Lock Guard only unlocks the mutex once they go out of scope. Since each iteration has 
                a sleep/delay time, this will cause blocking - meaning other threads cannot
                continue because that is the nature of locking to prevent race conditions.

                Instead, we create a inner scope and place any global variables/operations in it, 
                except the sleep/delay function. This way we lock thread, adjust shared variable(piesBaked) 
                and operate shared object(cout), once end of scope reached, it unlocks allowing other
                threads to continue while this one sleeps. This promotes true multithreading by utilizing 
                threads properly.

            /* What is lock_guard again?

                This is a object that allows automatic locking and unlocking of mutex and handles any exceptions
                if they arise. Without it you must manually lock/unlock using

                    mtx.lock()

                    mtx.unlock()

                The constructor calls mtx.lock().
                The destructor calls mtx.unlock().
